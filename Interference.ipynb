    "**General objective:** \n",
    "The objective of this module is to investigate the phenomenon of interference by examining the passage of various types of waves through a double slit. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the phenomena of diffraction and interference, as well as their interrelationship. Students will learn to calculate interference patterns using both analytical and numerical methods. Furthermore, we will explore the practical applications of interference, with a focus on using a gravimeter to determine the magnitude of the gravitational constant."

    "The double-slit experiment demonstrates that particles, such as electrons or photons, passing through two slits create an interference pattern on a screen, proving that they behave as waves. This experiment in modern physics is a key demonstration of wave-particle duality - a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. The hypothesis of the dual nature of waves and matter was first proposed by De Broglie in 1924, suggesting that each particle with momentum $p$ has a corresponding wavelength $\\lambda$, related to its momentum by the same equation as for photons:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is Planck's constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of experiment was first performed by Thomas Young in 1801, as a demonstration of the wave behavior of visible light. In 1927, Davisson and Germer demonstrated that electrons exhibit the same behavior, which was later extended to atoms and molecules, thus confirming de Broglie's hypothesis.\n",

    "Young's double-slit experiment, initially conducted with light, has been revisited and extended to various particles, most famously electrons. In 1961, Claus Jönsson performed the first successful double-slit experiment with electrons. In his setup, electrons were accelerated from a source to an energy of 50 keV. The slits, which were extremely narrow (about 0.5 μm) and spaced approximately 0.1 μm apart, were crafted on a thin copper foil. With this arrangement, Jönsson was able to observe clear interference patterns, demonstrating the wave-like behavior of electrons [C.Jonsson](https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1987592)."

This self-interference can be constructive or destructive, leading to regions of high and low probability of detecting the particle. The probability density at any point is proportional to $∣\\Psi∣^2$, which describes the likelihood of finding the particle at that location.\n",
